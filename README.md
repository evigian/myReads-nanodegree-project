# MyReads Project

This is the 7th project created for the FEND Google Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.

The starter code was provided by Udacity and was cloned from the following repository where you can see all the details about the project and its development: [Starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

The development of the project was based on the relative lessons of the course, the study jams performed by Udacity students and extra resources like Tyler McGinnis [React Bootcamp](https://tylermcginnis.com/free-react-bootcamp/).

## How to run the project

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, Udacity provides a backend server to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods that are needed to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository was made for the purposes of the FEND Nanodegree at Udacity. Any contribution which improves the project is welcome.
